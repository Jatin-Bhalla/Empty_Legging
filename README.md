# Empty_Legging
 possible names : Quaint-Plaine

"Empty legs"is an empty private jet which drops off its high-profile clients at their desired destination, on the return flight the planes don't have passengers for the way back, so they offer their seats to regular folks at discounts at a reduced price. 

This program/website/app will allow us to look at possible flights and flight patterns ( possibly after implemnting complex stuff!) allows user to book the luxury for quarter the price ! 

Deals like these, however, don't happen every day.
So this might be once in a BLUE moon's chance which honestly I wouldn't like to miss.

When you fly a private jet, you can show up at the airport minutes before takeoff. The security process happens in instants. You can bring a pet, eat off fine china and sit in tufted seats with your best friends. You'll fly to places the regular planes don't go, because you're not on a regular plane.


Other possible ideas for the project:
in terms of jet sharing options you can:

    Buy seats on scheduled flights much like the airlines.
    Join a crowd-sourced flight and see if another folks sign-up so it actually takes off.
    Look for crowd-sourced flights that have enough people already committed so you know it will be going.
    Join a membership program that lets you share with other members of the group.
    Join a membership program where you pay a monthly fee and fly as much as you want for free.
    Start your own crowd-sourced flight and see if you can get enough folks to share with you.
